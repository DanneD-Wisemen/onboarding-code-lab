# Onboarding Codelab starterkit

Howdy! Glad to see you here partner :)

## What is this?

This is a template for creating Google Codelabs. These can be used to create interactive tutorials for developers.

## How does it work?

It works using markdown files. When following a specific standard, Claat (Code labs as a thing) is a
tool that converts markdown files into a web page. It's a tool created by Google.

You can install the claat tool locally using Go. But then you have to install Go and set up your environment. It's a bit of a hassle. That's why I included the claat tool in this repository.

## How do I get started?

1. Clone this repository
2. Install Node if you don't have it already
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. The claat tool comes with the repository
5. Run `npm run serve` to start the local server
6. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser

## How do I edit the codelab?

1. Edit the `index.md` file
2. Run `npm run serve` to start the local server
3. Refresh your browser after making changes

## How do I publish the codelab?

You can use any hosting platform. I recommend netlify.com. It's free and easy to use.
