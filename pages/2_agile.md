## Agile
We want to work as efficient as possible. Therefore we use the Agile way of working. We created our custom [Agile Bible](https://theagilebible.com) where we describe how we work the Agile way. 

### 6.1 Agile Bible
The Agile Bible contains all the information you need to know about how we work the Agile way. (Work in Progress)
Take your time to read it and ask questions if you have any. 

Some key subjects:
* The Agile Manifesto
* Scrum Cycles
* User Stories
